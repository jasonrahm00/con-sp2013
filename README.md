# con-sp2013
While working at the CU College of Nursing, I was placed in charge of building and maintaining the internal Intranet. Central IT required we use the Sharepoint 2013 platform. In addition to designing and building out the site in the CMS, I also created some custom interfaces and widgets. This repository contains the raw code files for those customizations.
