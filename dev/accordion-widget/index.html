      <div class="accordion-content"> 
         <p>The Finance System also uses SpeedTypes. A SpeedType is an 8-digit shortcut for FOPPS (ChartField) combination. The first digit of a SpeedType represents the campus, the second and third digits stand for the fund, and the remaining five digits of the SpeedType are assigned by the PeopleSoft Finance System when the SpeedType is created. The PeopleSoft Finance System assigns SpeedTypes to FOPPS automatically at the time a request to create a new ChartField is made. SpeedTypes are used to speed entry of Fund, Organization, and Program/Project data on transactions.</p>

      <div class="accordion-content"> 
         <p>A Fund is a self-balancing set of records that includes assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and fund balance. The fund identifies the source of the money being received and spent. A Fund Group is a collection of funds that have a common purpose. The Fund Group is used to identify a general classification of resources.</p> 
         <p>The Fund ChartField contains values that broadly classify types of funding. This ChartField identifies the type of money being received or the type of money being spent.</p>

The donor may put time and/or purpose and/or matching requirements on the gifts, but there is no equal value returned in exchange for the money. Gifts may be deposited initially with the CU Foundation, and then be transferred into the university&#39;s financial system in order to spend the gifts, or gifts may be deposited directly to the university, depending on the donor&#39;s wishes. There is often some restricted purpose for the gifts. Gift fund management requires additional oversight to ensure that the gift is spent according to the donor&#39;s wishes.

   <h2>Procurement FAQs</h2> 
   <section class="accordion"> 
      <h3 class="accordion-header">Can I buy this?</h3> 
      <div class="accordion-content"> 
         <p>Before you buy it, refer to the PSC Procedural Statement: Tests of Propriety, and ask yourself the following questions.</p> 
         <p>Is this transaction: </p>
         <ul> 
            <li>For official university business?</li> 
            <li>In the best interests of the University?</li> 
            <li>The most effective way to accomplish official university business? Meaning that, without the expenses, would programmatic objectives be difficult or otherwise more costly to achieve? Or would the impact, level, or quality of the achievement be reduced?</li> 
            <li>In compliance with applicable policies, laws, regulations, and rules; and contracts, grants, and donor restrictions including having the required approvals and authorizations by the appropriate fiscal role?</li> 
            <li>Within the available resources of the responsibility unit, taking into consideration all outstanding commitments and encumbrances?</li> 
            <li>Directly beneficial to the responsibility unit where it is being charged?</li> 
            <li>Reasonable? Meaning that the quantity and quality of goods or services being purchased is sufficient to meet the University&#39;s identified need without exceeding it.</li> 
            <li>In compliance with university conflict of interest provisions? Meaning that, if an employee derives private gain, or appears to derive private gain, as a result of the transaction, then the transaction violates the conflict of interest provisions stated in Regent Law, Regent Policy, and in the Administrative Policy Statement, &quot;Conflicts of Interest and Commitment&quot;?</li>

               <ul> 
                  <li>Absolutely no travel is allowed on the procurement card. That means no hotel and no airfare. In limited circumstances, lodging is permitted only when combined with conference fees.</li>

For events or official functions, please refrain from using words like &quot;lunch&quot;, &quot;snacks&quot;, &quot;meals&quot;, or &quot;food&quot; in the explanation.

                  <li>Are you protecting the card at all times to prevent unauthorized use, and not sharing or authorizing others to use the card? Cardholders shall not share their cards or card numbers with other individuals. Only the designated Cardholder is allowed to use his or her procurement card. The procurement card should not be shared with other people because it would allow the University&#39;s bank to withdraw any fraud or other protections otherwise provided for the credit card.</li>

               <strong>Tax on purchases</strong> 
               <ul> 
                  <li>Taxes are frequently being charged, so start making it a habit to inform vendors upfront that the University is tax-exempt.</li>

               <ul> 
                  <li>Beware how Concur defaults to incorrect expense types. Occasionally, Concur will automatically default the expense type for you. For example, Concur will auto-populate 
                     <ul> 
                        <li>&quot;Dues and Professional Organizations&quot; when the correct expense type should be &quot;Registration Fees&quot;.</li>

                  <li>All transactions are required to be assigned to a report and submitted to the Approving Official within 30 days of the transaction date.</li> 
               </ul> 
            </li> 
            <li>
               <strong>1 report per month </strong> 
               <ul> 
                  <li>The University pays for every report that is processed. Please submit only one report per month.</li>

               <strong>LATE REPORTS</strong> 
               <ul> 
                  <li>Reports are consistently submitted late. All approvals would need to be completed by 5:00pm on the last business day of the month in order for expenses to post to their speed types. This is critical for sponsored projects so ensure reports are submitted early enough to obtain all required approvals.</li>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">What is an Official Function?</h3> 
      <div class="accordion-content"> 
         <p>The PSC Policy and Procedure Statement: Official Function Authorization defines and describes official functions, and also provides guidance for properly administering an official function. An official function is a meeting, meal, or other function that is hosted by an associate or employee of the university; is attended by guests and/or university associates or employees; and is held for official university business purposes as defined in Chapter 2 of the State of Colorado Fiscal Rules. Since official functions have the potential to be perceived as being for personal benefit or as a misuse of public funds, expenditures for such functions must be kept to a minimum. The attendance of state employees at an official function must also be limited, and should include only those individuals directly related to the purpose of the function. Due to the sensitive nature of official functions, the university requires that the Official Function Authorization Form be completed prior to any official function for which the estimated total food cost for the function exceeds $100 or the function includes alcohol, in any dollar amount, for an event being held at a site without a valid liquor license, whether that site is on-campus or off-campus.</p> 
         <p>
            <a href="http://www.cu.edu/psc/procedures/official-functions" target="_blank">CU Policies and Procedures Page</a></p> 
         <p>The PSC Procedural Statement lists the following items as the most common types of official functions</p> 
         <ul> 
            <li>Training functions. (Held to enhance staff knowledge or to educate employees, associates, or other individuals. Training functions should have written agendas, study materials, and be led by identified presenters.)</li> 
            <li>Community relation functions.</li> 
            <li>Employee recognition events and retirement functions.</li> 
            <li>Goodwill functions</li> 
            <li>Multi-unit or multi-campus events. (Participating units may not report to the same officer, and events may not occur more often than monthly). .</li> 
            <li>Recruitment functions. (Held to enlist new employees, students, etc.)</li> 
            <li>Student functions. (Hosted for students, and directly related to student/educational development, e.g., student recognition, student recruitment, and student program development.)</li> 
            <li>For purposes of determining the use of the Official Function (OF) form, the cost of an official function is the cost of food/beverage for personal consumption and related taxes/tips.</li> 
            <li>The organizational unit must complete the OF form if: 
               <ul> 
                  <li>The total cost of the official function exceeds $500; or,</li> 
                  <li>Regardless of total cost, the per-person cost of the official function exceeds $85.</li> 
               </ul> 
            </li> 
            <li>In addition to Organizational Unit Authorizing Signature, the OF form must be approved by an officer who is the appropriate campus oversight manager for this function if: 
               <ul> 
                  <li>The total cost of the official function exceeds $10,000; or,</li>
