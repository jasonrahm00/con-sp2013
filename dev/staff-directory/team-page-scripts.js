//Call directory list and filter for each team so you only have the individaul team to work with on the page instead of the whole list
//May have to refactor directory ajax call to accept string for team name
//How do you assign the team name on the page or in the template so it is reusable and dynamic for the team?
//Data on an html element?
//hidden dropdown?
//H1 text == team name?
//URL indexof?

/******* Probably best to do a data object on the main container that is the string of team name ********/
