<p>The ORS Areas of Excellence (AE) initiative (a) establishes zones of common research interest among College of Nursing faculty members for pursuit of collaborative projects and (b) helps inure new research faculty members to the CU CON research culture. The AEs are inter-disciplinary, inter-professional, and goal-oriented. To receive intramural funding, an AE project proposal must do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Include at least 4 CON faculty members (1 of whom is clinical-track)</li>
  <li>Include 1 faculty member from outside the CON (+ letter of support)</li>
  <li>Recruit/involve/mentor a CON student research collaborator</li>
  <li>Lay out a timeline for deliverables at regular intervals</li>
</ul>
