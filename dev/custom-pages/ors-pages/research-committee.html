  <h2>Intramural Awards</h2>
  <p>For each award, the Research Committee decides (a) when to send out an application solicitation email, (b) what deadline to set for receipt of applications, (c) who will review the applications, and (d) whom to recommend for the award. A letter is then prepared for signatures by both the Chair of the Research Committee and Associate Dean of Research and Scholarship. This letter is then forwarded to the Dean for approval. Once approved, a speed type is set up for the award.</p>
