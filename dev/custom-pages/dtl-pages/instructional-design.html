<p>The Instructional Design Team’s vision is to collaborate with faculty to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create effective, learner-centric learning experiences through innovative course design</li>
  <li>Utilize education theory and best practices in course and curriculum design and evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>We collaborate with CON faculty on instructional design and curricular evaluation.</p>

        <p>Meet Glenda Robertson. Glenda graduated with her Bachelor&#39;s in Nursing degree from the University of New Mexico in 1997. Upon graduation, she practiced in a Level III NICU as both a bedside nurse and a relief charge nurse. She also flew around the State of New Mexico as part of the Newborn Transport Team transporting critically ill newborns to the NICU.</p>
        <p>This early work encouraged the love of teaching both parents as well as new and student nurses. When the opportunity to manage a neonatal outreach program designed to teach doctors and nurses how to stabilize and/or ready neonates for transport came her way, she jumped at the chance. Thus, the transition to bedside nurse to academic nurse began.</p>
        <p>Glenda brings 20 years of nursing experience and 15 years of instructional design experience to her collaboration with faculty on course and curricular design and evaluation projects.</p>

        <p>Meet Sophia Strickfaden. Sophia earned her Masters of Arts in Information and Learning Technology and Bachelor’s of Arts in Psychology from the University of Colorado. She is published in Nursing Research, Annals of Behavioral Medicine, and the Journal for Forensic Nursing on topics related to end-of-life care, older adult exercise, e-learning, location-based technology, self-efficacy theory, and social behavioral theory. Sophia has co-authored papers and posters presented at the Society for Behavioral Medicine’s Annual Meetings.</p>
        <p>Prior to working at the College of Nursing, Sophia spent 5 years at Klein Buendel in Golden, CO working on health communications research projects. Her experience designing and developing health communications multimedia research interventions aids in her collaborations with faculty and staff at the CON.</p>
        <p>In Spring of 2017, Sophia completed an internship for the CON with Glenda as part of her Master’s Degree in Information and Learning Technologies at the University of Colorado Denver. She collaborated with Glenda, Candy, and other faculty to build and launch the New Teaching Faculty orientation course.</p>

    <h2>How We Do It</h2> 
    <p>We use Instructional Design Theory and learning theory to guide our design and best practices. Instructional Design is a mixture of cognitive, developmental, educational, and social psychology. We apply our understanding of how learning happens at various developmental stages within educational settings while considering social relationships.</p> 
    <p>Luckily, we have guiding theories to aid in design decisions.</p>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">Theories and Models (Instructional Design Central, n.d.<sup>1</sup>)</h3> 
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ADDIE:</strong> A model for a phased approach to developing courses and programs. The five phases are Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation.</li>
          <li><strong>Bloom’s Taxonomy:</strong> A theory by Benjamin Bloom which levels intellectual behavior of activities. Three categories are used to define behavior: affective, cognitive, and psychomotor. This taxonomy provides guidance for leveling of courses and programs.</li>
          <li><strong>Dick and Carey (1978):</strong> Also known as the Systems Approach Model, this model treats instruction as a system as opposed to each part in an isolated state. The system considers the interrelationship between context, content, learning, and instruction. This model emphasizes the elements all come together to achieve learning outcomes. Elements of note are the instructors and the learners.</li>
          <li><strong>Kemp:</strong> A nonlinear approach to instructional design by combining components of instructional design, development, and evaluation in a circular process. This allows for flexibility in the instructional design process and accounts for many factors, including student needs and characteristics, content and activities, resources and support services, and student assessment and evaluation tools and methods (Kemp Design Model, n.d.<sup>2</sup>).</li>
          <li><strong>Kirkpatrick:</strong> An process used for course and program evaluation done on four levels before, during, and after a program or course. The four levels are reaction, learning, behavior, and results. </li>
        </ul>

    <section> 
      <h3 class="accordion-header">Project Process</h3> 
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Our specialty is flexibility and coordination. Our course design and development process is determined by scope of changes and breadth and depth of course needs. There is a distinction between course design and then course development. The design phase is the process of making changes to the course and presenting changes to the undergraduate or graduate curriculum and evaluation committee as well as to faculty at large during the monthly General Faculty meeting. Once faculty have approved the changes, the development phase begins to operationalize the course changes.</p>

        <p>In the beginning of a project, we’ll work together to create a clear picture of our opportunities courses and curricular ideas. From there, we’ll plan according to the answers to our questions, including developing a timeline and a meeting schedule.</p>

          <h4>Example Questions We Ask</h4> 
          <ul>
            <li>Is this a new course, course revision, or curricular change?</li>
            <li>Where does this design project fit into the full curriculum or program?</li>
            <li>What do you want the students to be able to do and know upon completion of your course/program?</li>

  <h2>When We Do It</h2> 
  <p>One of the initial conversations faculty have with a member of the Instructional Design team revolves around the project’s timeline. A variety of factors influence how long a design and/or a development project will need. The goal is to work collaboratively to establish an efficient process so that there is a high return on the time invested by all.</p>
