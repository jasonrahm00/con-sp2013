        <p>Meet Glenda Robertson. Glenda graduated with her Bachelor's in Nursing degree from the University of New Mexico in 1997. Upon graduation, she practiced in a Level III NICU as both a bedside nurse and a relief charge nurse. She also flew around the State of New Mexico as part of the Newborn Transport Team transporting critically ill newborns to the NICU.</p>
        <p>This early work encouraged the love of teaching both parents as well as new and student nurses. When the opportunity to manage a neonatal outreach program designed to teach doctors and nurses how to stabilize and/or ready neonates for transport came her way, she jumped at the chance. Thus, the transition to bedside nurse to academic nurse began.</p>
        <p>Glenda brings 20 years of nursing experience and 15 years of instructional design experience to her collaboration with faculty on course and curricular design and evaluation projects.</p>

        <p>Meet Sophia Strickfaden. Sophia spends most of her time as an Instructional Design Specialist, coffee drinker, and smile giver. Her free time is often spent reading a book or exercising. Sophia is a Colorado Native through and through. She always knows which way is west and spends more weekends outside in the winter than in the summer.</p>
        <p>In Spring of 2017, Sophia completed an internship for the CON with Glenda as part of her Master’s Degree in Information and Learning Technologies at the University of Colorado Denver. She collaborated with Glenda, Candy, and other faculty to build and launch the New Teaching Faculty orientation course. Sophia missed Glenda and Candy so much after she finished her internship, so she came back full-time later in the year.</p>
        <p>Prior to joining the CON, Sophia spent 5 years at a small research company doing Instructional Design and completing research tasks. Her experience designing and developing health communications multimedia research interventions aids in her collaborations with faculty and staff at the CON.</p>

    <h2>How We Do It</h2>
    <p>We use Instructional Design Theory and learning theory to guide our design and best practices. Instructional Design is a mixture of cognitive, developmental, educational, and social psychology. We apply our understanding of how learning happens at various developmental stages within educational settings while considering social relationships</p>
    <p>Luckily, we have guiding theories to aid in design decisions.</p>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">Theories and Models (Instructional Design Central, n.d.<sup>1</sup>)</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ADDIE:</strong> A model for a phased approach to developing courses and programs. The five phases are Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation.</li>
          <li><strong>Bloom’s Taxonomy:</strong> A theory by Benjamin Bloom which levels intellectual behavior of activities. Three categories are used to define behavior: affective, cognitive, and psychomotor. This taxonomy provides guidance for leveling of courses and programs.</li>
          <li><strong>Dick and Carey (1978):</strong> Also known as the Systems Approach Model, this model treats instruction as a system as opposed to each part in an isolated state. The system considers the interrelationship between context, content, learning, and instruction. This model emphasizes the elements all come together to achieve learning outcomes. Elements of note are the instructors and the learners.</li>
          <li><strong>Kemp:</strong> A nonlinear approach to instructional design by combining components of instructional design, development, and evaluation in a circular process. This allows for flexibility in the instructional design process and accounts for many factors, including student needs and characteristics, content and activities, resources and support services, and student assessment and evaluation tools and methods (Kemp Design Model, n.d.<sup>2</sup>).</li>
          <li><strong>Kirkpatrick:</strong> An process used for course and program evaluation done on four levels before, during, and after a program or course. The four levels are reaction, learning, behavior, and results. </li>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">Project Process</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Our specialty is flexibility and coordination. In general, our project process follows this pattern:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Initial Meeting</li>
          <li>Gathering Content, Resources, Information</li>
          <li>Follow-up Meetings</li>
          <li>Review Opportunities for Enhancements</li>
          <li>Write Report</li>
          <li>Determine Next Steps (i.e. Course Proposal to UCEC/GCEC)</li>

    <section>
      <h3 class="accordion-header">Planning Details</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>In the beginning of a project, we’ll work together to create a clear picture of our opportunities courses and curricular ideas. From there, we’ll plan according to the answers to our questions, including developing a timeline and a meeting schedule.</p>
        <section class="margin-top-small">
          <h4>Example Questions We Ask</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>How are you?</li>
            <li>Is this a new course, course revision, or curricular change?</li>
            <li>Where does this design project fit into the full curriculum or program?</li>
            <li>What do you want the students to be able to do and know upon completion of your course/program?</li>

<section class="margin-vertical-medium">
  <h2>When We Do It</h2>
  <p>The general timeline of our work takes about 3-12 months to complete. For larger changes with curriculum considerations (i.e. proposing changes to program outcomes) it will take longer than 12 months. Once a course or curricular change is approved, it may take 3-12 months to implement.</p>
