        <p>Candace goes by Candy, but her grandkids call her Nonni. She spends most of her time being an Associate Professor and the Director of Faculty Development in the University of Colorado College of Nursing. If asked what she does in her free time, Candy’s answer is, “Free time? I haven’t had that since before I was a nurse!” But, she will admit she enjoys walking and reading when she has a spare moment.</p>
        <p>In 2013, Candy decided it was time for her to join the CON faculty. Shortly after she arrived, was elected as UCEC chair. She served as chair of UCEC from 2013-2015. But, Candy’s story of CON service and leadership doesn’t end in 2015. Since 2015, she has served as a member of APT representing the non-tenure track faculty.  She has also served on numerous task forces and search committees.</p>
        <p>Candy enjoys her time with faculty along with her time with students. Candy teaches online courses in the nursing RN-BS undergraduate and the education certificate programs. And as for time with faculty, she develops and implements faculty development opportunities for CON faculty as Director of Faculty Development.</p>
        <p>Candy is always available for visits, phone calls, and sharing resources. In fact, she loves her faculty development work so much she is currently an advisory board member for the Colorado Collaborative for Preparing Future Faculty Network. Candy is an expert and community leader for faculty development.</p>
        <p>Candy has a rich educational background accompanied by many years of experience in academics and nursing. Dr. Berardinelli earned her BSN at the University of Pittsburgh and both her MS/ANP and PhD in nursing at the University of Colorado College of Nursing.</p>
